# **Day 2 Notes**

To deploy repositories to `GitHub Pages` :
- Open up the settings in the repo you want to deploy.
- On the left hand side, click the tab that says `pages`.
- Under source, where it says `None`, change it to `main`, then hit save.
- You will be given a link, copy and paste that into the about section of the repo. 
- You have successfully added your repo to `GitHub Pages`!

To get to the settings in `VS Code`, hit :
```
ctrl + ","
```

Putting "*" in `CSS` will match with any element listed in html.

To grab a class in html in css, you have to put a "." infront of the class. 
```
ex: 
class="whatever" in the html doc. To grab in CSS .whatever
```

To grab an id in html in css you have to put a "#"  infront of the id.
```
ex:
id="whatever" in html doc, To grab in CSS #whatever
```

When linking external fonts the linking option needs to put into the head of the html doc. The importing option needs to go at the top of the css file.

`"code ."` in the terminal will open vs code for that repo.

`"alt + arrow keys"` = move code line

`"alt + arrow keys + shift"` = copy code line

`"!"` after opening an index.html file will give an html template
